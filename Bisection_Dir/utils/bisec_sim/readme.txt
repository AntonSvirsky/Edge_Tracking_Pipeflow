Pre-compiled long openpipeflow simulation with time limit T_bisec and low saving rate.  
 - If T_bisec is too short to achieve a classification, another simulation will be initiated with the initial conditions taken from the last snapshot.  
 - This process repeats until a classification is achieved.  
 - The saving rate should be kept relatively low to reduce memory usage.
