Pre-compiled long openpipeflow simulation simulation time limit T_fwd with a high saving rate.  
 - T_fwd sets the maximum integration time for the bounding trajectories and should be slightly longer than the expected separation time.  
 - The high saving rate ensures that the states can be used for spatio-temporal analysis of the edge states.
